# Members-Repo

**Greetings Members of ACE, SASTRA!**

This is a demo test for our tech clusters to work on.  
We start this year with a rather simple task: **Create your own Profile Dashboard.**

---

## Instructions

Each member is tasked with the creation of their own profile page, irrespective of the stack used. The deal is simple:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local system.  
2. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account.  
3. **Create a branch** (name: `your-name`). Switch to that branch.  
4. **Create a folder** in the branch (folder name: `your-name`).  
5. Create your **profile project** and save it.  
6. Create a **PR (Pull Request)** from your branch to the `main` branch.  

**Note:**  
- Any approach can be used.  
- Backend development is not requiredâ€”a simple **UI** will suffice.

**If any doubts arise, feel free to open a discussion!**

Regards,  
**TEAM ACE**
