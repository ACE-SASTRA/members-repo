# members-repo
Greetings! Members of ACE, SASTRA. This is a demo test for our tech clusters to work on.
We start this year with a rather simple task. Create your own Profile Dashboard. 

# Instructions are as follows:
Each member is tasked with the creation of their own profile page, irrespective of stack used.
Deal is simple:
      1) Clone this repository to your local system.
      2) Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
      2) Create a branch (name: your name). Switch to that branch
      3) Create a folder in the branch(folder name: 'your-name')
      4) Create your profile project and save it.
      5) Create a PR(Pull Request) from your branch to main branch
Note: Any approach can be used. No need to delve into the backend side, a simple UI is enough.

If any doubts, always open for Discussion!
     -Regards, 
          TEAM ACE.
